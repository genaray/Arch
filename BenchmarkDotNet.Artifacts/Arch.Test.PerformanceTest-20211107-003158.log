// Validating benchmarks:
Assembly Arch which defines benchmarks is non-optimized
Benchmark was built without optimization enabled (most probably a DEBUG configuration). Please, build it in RELEASE.
If you want to debug the benchmarks, please see https://benchmarkdotnet.org/articles/guides/troubleshooting.html#debugging-benchmarks.
