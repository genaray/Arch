A high-performance C# based Archetype & Chunks [Entity Component System](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Entity_component_system) (ECS) for game development and data-oriented programming.     

- üèéÔ∏è **_FAST_** > Best cache efficiency, iteration, and allocation speed. Plays in the same league as C++/Rust ECS Libs! 
- üöÄ **_FASTER_** > Arch is on average quite faster than other ECS implemented in C#. Check out this [Benchmark](https://github.com/Doraku/Ecs.CSharp.Benchmark)!
- ü§è **_BARE MINIMUM_** >  Not bloated, it's small and only provides the essentials for you! 
- ‚òïÔ∏è **_SIMPLE_** >  Promotes a clean, minimal, and self-explanatory API that is simple by design. Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/genaray/Arch/wiki)!
- üí™ _**MAINTAINED**_ > It's actively being worked on, maintained, and comes along several [Extensions](https://github.com/genaray/Arch.Extended)! 
- üö¢ _**SUPPORT**_ > Supports .NetStandard 2.1, .Net Core 6 and 8, and therefore you may use it with Unity or Godot!

Download the [package](https://github.com/genaray/Arch/packages/1697222), get started today and join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/htc8tX3NxZ)!
```console
dotnet add PROJECT package Arch --version 2.0.0
```

# ‚è© Quickstart

Arch is bare minimum, easy to use, and efficient. Let's say you want to create some game entities and make them move based on their velocity... sounds complicated?
It's not! Arch does everything for you, you only need to define the entities and the logic.

I bet you don't want to read tons of documentation, theory, and other boring stuff right?  
Let's just ignore all that deep knowledge and jump in directly to get something done. 

```cs
using Arch;

// Components
public record struct Position(float X, float Y);
public record struct Velocity(float Dx, float Dy);

// Create a world and an entity with position and velocity.
using var world = World.Create();
var adventurer = world.Create(new Position(0,0), new Velocity(1,1));

// Enumerate all entities with Position & Velocity to move them
var query = new QueryDescription().WithAll<Position,Velocity>();
world.Query(in query, (Entity entity, ref Position pos, ref Velocity vel) => {
    pos.X += vel.Dx;
    pos.Y += vel.Dy;
    Console.WriteLine($"Moved adventurer: {entity.Id}"); 
}); 
```
> [!NOTE]
> The example is very simple. There more features including queries without lambda or an API without generics and much more. Checkout the [Documentation](https://arch-ecs.gitbook.io/arch)!

# üí° Highlights

This is all you need to know, with this little knowledge you are already able to bring your worlds to life.

# üß© Extensions

Arch has some extensions that add more features and tools. Among them for example : 
- üõ†Ô∏è **_[Arch.Extended](https://github.com/genaray/Arch.Extended)_** >  Adds a set of tools and features to save boilerplate code!
- üîé *_[Godot Entity Debugger](https://github.com/RoadTurtleGames/ArchGodotEntityDebugger)_* > An Arch Entity debugger for the Godot engine!
- üîé *_[Stride Entity Debugger](https://github.com/Doprez/stride-arch-ecs)_* > An example of Arch in the Stride engine, with additional entity and system inspector!
- üîé *_[Arch.Unity](https://github.com/AnnulusGames/Arch.Unity)_* > A library that makes the integration of Arch in Unity much easier, with many cool new features!
- üîé *_[Zinc-Framework](https://github.com/zinc-framework)_* > A small but fine engine framework which is based on Arch and also has its own source generator to define entities declaratively!
- ‚ùì **_Your Tool-Library?_** > If you develop more tools and features for Arch, let us know and we'll list them here!

# üöÄ Performance
Arch is already one of the fastest ECS and uses the best techniques under the hood to achieve maximum performance and efficiency. 
Care is always taken to find a healthy balance between CPU performance and ram utilization. 

If you are more interested, have a look at the [benchmark](https://github.com/Doraku/Ecs.CSharp.Benchmark)!

# üíª Projects using Arch
Arch is already used in some projects, for a more detailed look, take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/genaray/Arch/wiki/Projects-using-Arch)!

## [Space Station 14](https://spacestation14.io/)
Space Station 14 is inspired by the cult classic Space Station 13 and tells the extraordinary story of everything that can go wrong on a shift at a space station. You take on a role and complete your tasks so that the space station doesn't go to the dogs... or do the exact opposite. Prepare yourself for chaos and the finest roleplay. Best of all, SS14 is open-source and anyone can play!
